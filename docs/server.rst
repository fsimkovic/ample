=======

Currently an online websever to run AMPLE is available through CCP4 online:

.. raw:: html

   <br>
   <div>
       <a target="_blank" href="https://ccp4online.ccp4.ac.uk/ccp4online/" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">Go to CCP4 Online Server</a>
   </div>
   </br>

.. note::
    AMPLE will be made available through CCP4 cloud too before long

..
  AMPLE is also available through CCP4-Cloud:

    .. raw:: html

       <br>
       <div>
           <a target="_blank" href="http://ccp4serv6.rc-harwell.ac.uk/jscofe/" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">Go to CCP4 Cloud</a>
       </div>
       </br>

    These make some of the most popular protocols available in an easy-to-use form but greater flexibility is accessible through the CCP4 GUIs or the command line.
