"""Main route into Ample

The code here needs to be protected by if __name__ == '__main__'
to prevent multiprocessing on windows rerunning the main ample code when it
imports the main module again.

A bug in multiprocessing means that we can't use the __main__.py file and -m switch
to ccp4-python under windows.
